### 3. Recurring Detection with Statistical Confidence
**Novelty:** Uses standard deviation for confidence: `C = 100 - (σ/μ × 100)`
**Key Innovation:** Variance-based confidence, not simple frequency counting
**File Location:** `apps/api/src/modules/ai/bank-intelligence/recurring-detector.service.ts`
