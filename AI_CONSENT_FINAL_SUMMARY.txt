[PASS] Code review - Dialog centering implemented correctly
[BLOCKED] Dialog runtime testing - requires authentication
[BLOCKED] Sidebar accessibility - requires authentication

CODE REVIEW FINDINGS:

1. Dialog Centering - CORRECT
   File: apps/web/src/components/ui/dialog.tsx (line 55)
   CSS: fixed left-[50%] top-[50%] translate-x-[-50%] translate-y-[-50%]
   Result: Dialog will be properly centered

2. Responsive Sizing - CORRECT
   File: apps/web/src/components/consent/AIConsentDialog.tsx (line 68)
   Mobile: w-[95vw] max-h-[85vh]
   Desktop: max-w-2xl max-h-[80vh]
   Result: Dialog will fit in viewport on all screen sizes

3. Content Scrolling - CORRECT
   ScrollArea with max-h-[40vh] mobile, max-h-[45vh] desktop
   Result: Content will scroll if too long, preventing overflow

4. Z-Index - NEEDS VERIFICATION
   Dialog: z-50
   Sidebar: z-auto
   Question: Should sidebar be accessible while dialog is open?

=== WHAT WE VERIFIED ===
- Dialog CSS uses correct centering technique
- Responsive breakpoints prevent viewport overflow
- ScrollArea prevents content cutoff
- Code follows best practices

=== WHAT NEEDS MANUAL TESTING ===
- Dialog actually appears centered in browser
- Dialog not cut off on different screen sizes
