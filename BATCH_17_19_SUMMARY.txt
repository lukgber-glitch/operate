CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. Missing Pages: 7 routes return ERR_ABORTED (not implemented)
2. Auth Failures: 7 routes redirect to login despite being authenticated
3. Wrong Redirects: 2 intelligence routes redirect to wrong HR pages

NEXT STEPS:
1. Re-authenticate user in browser
2. Fix missing route implementations
3. Debug authentication middleware
4. Fix intelligence route redirects
