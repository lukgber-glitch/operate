  "reasoning": "tigerVAT offers 6-10x faster implementation (3-5 days vs 15-30 days), 30-50x lower total cost of ownership when including developer time (€240-600/year vs €20,000-35,000/year), zero maintenance burden, and English documentation. For a SaaS platform targeting SMEs with an international development team, the REST API approach eliminates technical debt and enables focus on core product features rather than infrastructure complexity. The ERiC SDK's complexity (C library + FFI bindings + German-only docs + certificate management + ongoing updates) creates substantial risk and opportunity cost that far outweighs its 'free' licensing.",
