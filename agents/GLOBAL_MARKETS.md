## CHINA ANALYSIS (NOT RECOMMENDED)

### Why China is Extremely Complex:

1. **Golden Tax System (Fapiao)**
   - Government-controlled invoice system
   - Requires physical tax control devices (税控盘)
   - All invoices must be registered with tax authority in real-time
   - Multiple types: VAT Special, VAT Normal, Electronic

2. **Payment Integration Requirements**
   - WeChat Pay: Requires Chinese business license
   - Alipay: Requires Chinese business license
   - UnionPay: Complex integration requirements

3. **Regulatory Barriers**
   - Must have Chinese legal entity (WFOE)
   - Data must be stored on Chinese servers
   - Great Firewall blocks many foreign services
   - PIPL (Personal Information Protection Law) compliance

4. **Technical Challenges**
   - All systems in Simplified Chinese
   - Limited English documentation
   - No standard APIs - requires certified tax hardware
   - Bank integrations require Chinese banking licenses

5. **Market Entry Cost**
   - Estimated: $500K-$2M for compliant entry
   - Timeline: 12-24 months minimum

**Recommendation:** Focus on overseas Chinese businesses instead (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore) which use Western-compatible systems.
