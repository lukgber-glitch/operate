# Plan 02-01: Create Clean Working State

## Overview
**Phase**: 2 - Local Preparation
**Goal**: Ensure we have a clean baseline before making cleanup changes
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 complete

## Context

Since this is a git repository, we don't need to physically duplicate the directory. Instead, we:
1. Verify current git state
2. Create a checkpoint commit or stash if needed
3. Establish a clean baseline for cleanup work

## Tasks

### Task 1: Check current git status
Review uncommitted changes and determine what needs to be preserved vs cleaned.

### Task 2: Identify files to remove
Categorize files in git status:
- **Keep**: Legitimate code changes
- **Remove**: Junk files (screenshots, test scripts, temp files)
- **Review**: Documentation that may or may not be needed

### Task 3: Create baseline
If there are legitimate uncommitted changes, stash or commit them before cleanup.

## Verification

- [ ] Git status reviewed
- [ ] Files categorized (keep/remove/review)
- [ ] Baseline established (clean working state or stashed)

## Notes

- The git history serves as our backup - no physical duplication needed
- We can always recover deleted files from git if needed
