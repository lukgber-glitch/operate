# Plan 03-02: Audit .gitignore

## Overview
**Phase**: 3 - Security Audit
**Goal**: Ensure all sensitive files are excluded from version control
**Dependencies**: 03-01 complete

## Audit Results

### Files Checked
- [x] No .env files tracked in git
- [x] No .env files in working directory (clean state)
- [x] .env.example files properly included

### .gitignore Entries

| Category | Entries | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Environment files | `.env`, `.env.*` with exceptions for `.example` | ENHANCED |
| Build outputs | `dist/`, `build/`, `.next/` | OK |
| Dependencies | `node_modules/`, `.pnpm-store/` | OK |
| IDE files | `.idea/`, `.vscode/` | OK |
| OS files | `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db` | OK |
| Logs | `*.log` | OK |
| Test artifacts | `test-*.js`, `screenshot-*.png` | ADDED |
| Keys/certs | `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12` | ADDED |
| Credentials | `credentials.json`, `service-account*.json` | ADDED |
| Secrets directories | `secrets/`, `keys/` | ADDED |
| Planning backups | `.planning/backups/` | OK |

### Improvements Made
1. Changed `.env.*.local` to `.env.*` with negation for `.example` files
2. Added certificate/key file patterns (`.pem`, `.key`, `.p12`, `.pfx`)
3. Added Google credentials pattern (`credentials.json`)
4. Added service account pattern (`service-account*.json`)
5. Added secrets/keys directories

## Verification

- [x] No sensitive files tracked
- [x] .gitignore covers all common secret patterns
- [x] Example files are still allowed

## Result: PASS (with improvements)
.gitignore has been enhanced for better security coverage.
