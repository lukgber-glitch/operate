## Key Strategic Decisions

### 1. Why 4 Tiers?
- **Free** = Acquisition engine (freemium model)
- **Starter** = Entry point for serious users
- **Pro** = Sweet spot (target 60-70% of paid users)
- **Business** = Premium/teams

### 2. Why These Price Points?
- **€19:** Premium to basic German competitors (€8-10), justified by AI
- **€39:** 2x mid-tier market (€16-20), but 10x automation value
- **€69:** Competitive with enterprise tools, adds API/multi-user

### 3. Why Freemium + Trial (Hybrid)?
- **Freemium:** Drives 10x more signups, lower CAC
- **14-day trial:** Converts 25-35% (industry benchmark)
- **Hybrid:** Free users can trial paid features when hitting limits

### 4. Why 14 Days (Not 7 or 30)?
- **Research:** 7-day trials convert 20% better than 30-day
- **14 days = sweet spot** for B2B SaaS (industry standard)
- **Balance:** Enough time to onboard, short enough to create urgency

## Risk Mitigation

| **Price too high for market** | Free tier + trial remove risk, ROI messaging |
| **Free tier cannibalizes paid** | Strategic limits, automation only in paid tiers |

## Quick Decision Framework

- **NO** if trial → paid conversion >25%
- **NO** if churn <7% monthly
- **NO** if 60%+ choose Pro tier
- **YES** if lots of "too expensive" feedback
- **YES** if free tier conversion <2%

**When to add Enterprise tier?**
- After 3+ inbound requests for >3 users
- After 50+ Business tier customers
- When revenue >€10k MRR

**When to increase prices?**
- After product-market fit (6-12 months)
